## Quotes:

‚ú® The human body is designed for continuous activity.

‚ú® Loss of muscle tissue or its breakdown is associated with aging and the one thing that will turn exercise into an anti-aging activity is protein. Because amino acids help us repair our tissues and recover from the stress that exercises place on our body.

## Thoughts:

This book gives the most fundamental understanding of how the diet and stomach work and how the human body functions with regular exercise and a healthy diet.

Diet has become a scary thing for everybody out there. People have come to the conclusion that diet is a means to harm your body to lose weight, that‚Äôs how diet is being marketed.

The truth is that diet is just the consumption of healthy food necessary for our body which includes all kinds of nutrients needed for it.

People follow intense diet plans, which is absolutely unnecessary when you understand how your stomach works. We care about our heart, lungs and liver and etc, oftentimes we forget about the stomach.

> This book stresses understanding the working of the stomach. What exactly does it need to function properly and keep you healthy and fit?

According to Ayurveda, the mind, and body are connected, if the mind accepts a healthy diet, the body does. If your mind is healthy and positive, your body will glow with good vibes and stay healthy.


Exercise is non-negotiable. Unless you exercise, you‚Äôll never see enough results.

üéØ Exercise suggestions :

- Weight training: twice a week for not more than 60mins.

- Yoga: You can do yoga daily, keep your stomach relatively empty before you start yoga, and have a healthy meal post your yoga class.

- Walking: Try running for 30mins, try running instead of just walking. Start small, run for 30secs, and build up slowly to 3 to 13 mins over few months. Try interval training, run for a while, then walk and keep repeating this cycle.
