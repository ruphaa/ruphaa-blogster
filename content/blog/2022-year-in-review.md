Well, it’s been a great year. It's been 3 years since I wrote my last year-in-review. This year I took some time to reflect on what happened in 2022. It's been a fantastic year for me, both in my career and personal life.

### ✨ I joined Canva's design system team

I feel incredibly honored and grateful to be a part of Canva ♥️ especially the Design System team.
Ever since I joined, it's been a beautiful journey of constant learning and admiration.

It has given me some of the best learning I’ve done in my life. Looking forward to learning more and contributing more to this journey.

### ✨ I joined The 5 AM Club

Yes, it's utterly surprising but at the same time, miraculous. 
It's a great way to make the most of the day and achieve my goals ☀️.

### ✨ I redid my website using Blogster

With the magic of [Blogster](https://twitter.com/flexdinesh/status/1605685191703687168), I redid my entire website in just a single afternoon. I now call it my "Digital garden 🪴". 

I feel liberated to write more about any content or notes I want to share or keep it as a reference without overthinking or over-preparing.

### ✨ I read 35 books this year

Initially, I planned to complete 50 books and but I failed, which in a way worked out well for me. I took time to cherish every single book I read and it's been fantastic. This year I'm looking forward to diving deep into more non-fiction books.

### ✨ I journaled every single day

After watching a thousand youtube videos, I got inspired to start journaling. In the past year alone, I incorporated different techniques and prompts for journaling. Finally, at the end of 2022, I figured out a method that works well for me.

I'd highly recommend getting a [5-year journal](https://www.amazon.com.au/Modern-One-Line-Day-Five-Year/dp/1452164622/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_1/357-2686103-2137349?pd_rd_w=XYT7Q&content-id=amzn1.sym.a30612ba-4ff5-4362-b7a7-e874eb18a520&pf_rd_p=a30612ba-4ff5-4362-b7a7-e874eb18a520&pf_rd_r=YKF1DKS2YJWGZZ2EYWZZ&pd_rd_wg=p5Udc&pd_rd_r=6ad68671-a72d-4890-b6ac-1f4e4d7bc834&pd_rd_i=1452164622&psc=1) notebook for anyone who wants to start journaling. It only allows 3 - 4 lines to write but that's enough to capture the highlight of the day without much effort. Happy Journaling!

### ✨ I started my fitness journey

The highlight of the year. I've been trying to stay fit by trying different activities on and off like yoga, dancing, boxing, weights, etc. This year, I've finally established a workout routine that works well for me which includes predominantly lifting weights and running, every single day. 

_PS: I now have a newfound love for running and bouldering 🧗‍♀️_

### ✨ Bummers
- Bought a 2022 planner but hardly used it 🙅‍♀️📓
- Not being active in webdev community 😿
- Didn't read 50 books as I planned and marked in GoodReads.
- Underestimated the effort required and was being over-optimistic about time.
- Didn't realize time is limited and worked on tasks that didn't contribute to my goals (Busy, but not productive ⌛️).
- Wanted to write more blog posts.  

### ✨ Lessons learned

Setbacks are inevitable. Mistakes don't define us but what we learn from them does.
- Work on Essentialism
    - Setting realistic goals.
    - Work on planning and prioritization.
    - Be thorough and produce quality work and content.
- Focus on one thing at a time.
- Being busy is different from being productive.
- Discipline is the key to freedom. 

### ✨ What's in store for 2023

I'm not doing any resolutions this year, instead, I've set some goals for which I've mapped out some systems to follow through.
- Be more active in webdev community([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ruphaaganesh) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruphaaganesh/)).
- Build more projects and codepens in public.
- Create more content (Write a minimum of 24 blog posts this year).
- Read 30 books.
- Travel local. Do more adventurous stuff(hiking, canyoning 😉).

### End credits

If I had to describe 2022 in one word, I'd say **"Learning"**. I'm grateful for having had tons of learning opportunities this year. 
I'm thrilled and excited for 2023, we have the whole year ahead of us full of potential and possibilities. 

If anything the past couple of years have taught us, it is the uncertainty. Cherish every single day and be grateful for every single thing we have.

That's all folks. Thanks for staying till the end. I wish you all a stunning year ahead! See you soon 👋

Cheers 🥂
